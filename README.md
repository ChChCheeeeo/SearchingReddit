# Goal

This is an example of small search engine that allows people to search over /r/learnprogramming subreddit.

The goal of the project is to build a small but functional search engine and live stream it on youtube: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL18yrUuMk-zlzpea3En7GRZLvFn7WNK0H

# Contribution policy

As an experiment, there is a contribution policy. There are a number of issues available, each week you can choose one of them and work on it. Currently there is a limit of one issue per week per contributor, so that multiple people can work on it. (This is a project for learning purposes!)

If you choose to work on an issue, PLEASE tell it in comments!
